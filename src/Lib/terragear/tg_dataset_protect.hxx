// datasets should only be open by one thread at a time
// we have a potentially HUGE number of datasets, however, as
// each tile is represented by one.

// we CAN open multiple datasets at the same time.

// so we keep a map of tiles. 
// if an entry is not in the map, it is available to use.
// if an entry IS in the map, we will queue up on a condition
// variable until it is ready

// when a tile becomes available, we will signal a waiting task
// so it can use it.

// when the last task is finished with a tile,  it is remved from 
// the map.


// structure containg information about a tile
// in use, number of waiters, etc...
